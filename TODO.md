## Should


## Could

- Overtime automatically after draw.
- Weapon picking upgrade (secondary/picking from opposite team).
- Keep score during warm-up.
- No weapon menu if no choice.

## Would

- Check autobalance and its weapon choice/spawn effects (ChangeTeam()).
- Warmup with deathmatch spawns.
- Detect disallowed jumps.
- Bash for side/map.
- Memorize result from previous game.
- Vote/veto for map(s) pre-game.
- Restart map/mod on empty server.
- Anti fast shoot for weapons other than kar/mos.
- Configurable: Clarify killing during warm-up (icon?).
- Rebrand 'strat' as e.g. (grace period) freeze time.
- Rebrand 'warmup' as e.g. round restart delay.
- auto_change name during readying.
- Auto demo/screenshot mechanism (probably not optimal).
- Test SD timelimit.
- Check if Punkbuster can detect client cvar changes faster. (To prevent quick toggling.)
- Intermission for half-time switch.
