## Must

- Code restructuring.
- CVAR loop and good setup/rules infrastrcture.

## Should

- Remove `weapons` files in favour of raising damage via script.
- Check autobalance and its weapon choice/spawn effects (ChangeTeam()).

## Could

- Fix strat time lag bind bug.
- Overtime automatically after draw.
- Weapon picking upgrade (single, secondary/picking from opposite team).
- Keep score during warm-up.
- No weapon menu if no choice.

## Would

- Warmup with deathmatch spawns.
- Detect disallowed jumps.
- Bash for side/map.
- Memorize result from previous game.
- Vote/veto for map(s) pre-game.
- Restart map/mod on empty server.
- Anti fast shoot for weapons other than kar/mos.
- Configurable: Allow killing during warmup.
- Rebrand 'strat' as e.g. (grace period) freeze time.
- Rebrand 'warmup' as e.g. round restart delay.
- auto_change name during readying.
- Auto demo/screenshot mechanism (probably not optimal).
