# Vanilla Project Ares Mod

vPAM is continuing the legacy of the most popular competetive server mod for Call of Duty (2003). This project aims to be a more central hub to collect ideas and changes surrounding competetive gameplay.

## History

PAM was first conceived by Michael Berkowitz (GaretJax) and last released version [1.08](https://web.archive.org/web/20060205201311/http://garetgg.com/xoops/modules/mydownloads/) in 2005. reissue_/zyquist built his 1.11 (2015) rPAM version supposedly on a 1.09 ClanBase and 1.10 CyberGamer version.

Many people have made their own versions, ranging from color adjustments to rule changes. Thus many different versions have been circulating in the community.

vPAM does not build on rPAM, but on a widely circulating version probably based on the 1.09 ClanBase version. To prevent confusion with other versions, vPAM will continue at 1.12.
