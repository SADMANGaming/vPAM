# Call of Duty mod


## Competetive ideas

Additional:

- Fast shooting detection.
- Strat time fix (lag binding).
- Warmup with deathmatch spawns.
- Detect disallowed jumps.
- Bash for side/map.
- Memorize result from previous game.
- Overtime.
- Timeout rules.
- Force demo (?).
- Vote/veto for map(s) pre-game.
- No weapon menu on match half (if no choice).

Basic concepts of competetive (Project Ares Mod):

- Ready-up phase.
- Switch teams in half.
- Strat time.
- Players alive.
- Round end score display.
- Drop no weapons (?).
- playsound("axisgoat");
